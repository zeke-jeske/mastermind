# Mastermind

A React web application to play Mastermind against the computer. Let me know if you want to contribute to the project. Eventually I also hope to make it possible to play two player games over the Internet.

This project built using Typescript, JavaScript, SASS, and React. You can play the most recent
version at [zekes-mastermind-game.herokuapp.com](https://zekes-mastermind-game.herokuapp.com).

## Getting Started

1. Run `yarn` to install packages.
2. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server, or `yarn build && yarn start` to build and run the production version.
