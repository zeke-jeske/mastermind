# Mastermind

A simple React app to play Mastermind against the computer. Let me know if you want to contribute to the project. Eventually I also hope to make it possible to play two player games over the Internet.

This project built using Typescript, JavaScript, SASS, and React. The live version is hosted
at [mastermind-oc9j.onrender.com/](https://mastermind-oc9j.onrender.com/).

## Getting Started

1. Run `yarn` to install packages.
2. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server, or `yarn build && yarn start` to build and run the production version.
