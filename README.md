# Mastermind

A React web application to play Mastermind against the computer. It doesn't work yet, but I'm building the React components piece by piece. Let me know if you want to contribute to the project. Eventually I hope to make it possible to do two player games over the Internet, but that's not yet possible.

This project uses Typescript, JavaScript, SASS, and React. It was built using Create React App.
